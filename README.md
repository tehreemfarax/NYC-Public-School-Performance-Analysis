# NYC-Public-School-Performance-Analysis

This project aims to analyze data from New York City (NYC) schools to derive insights regarding academic performance. The provided Python script utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. The analysis focuses on determining:

1. **Schools with the Best Math Results**: Identifying NYC schools with the highest average math scores.

2. **Top Performing Schools based on Combined SAT Scores**: Determining the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores in math, reading, and writing.

3. **Borough with the Largest Standard Deviation in SAT Scores**: Identifying the borough with the highest standard deviation in combined SAT scores.

## Instructions

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary data file named `schools.csv`.
   - Make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib).

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the provided Python script in your preferred environment.
   - The script will read the data from the CSV file, perform analysis, and generate visualizations.

3. **Review the Results**:
   - Analyze the generated outputs to gain insights into the performance of NYC schools.
   - The script generates bar charts and data tables for easy interpretation.

## Code Overview

The script consists of the following main sections:

- **Data Loading**: Reads the data from the `schools.csv` file using Pandas.

- **Analysis and Visualization**:
  - Identifies schools with the best math results.
  - Determines the top 10 performing schools based on combined SAT scores and visualizes them with customized legends.
  - Finds the borough with the largest standard deviation in combined SAT scores and presents the relevant statistics.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization, particularly for creating bar charts.

## Note

- This script assumes that the provided CSV file (`schools.csv`) contains the required data in the expected format.
- Ensure that all Python dependencies are installed before running the script.

Feel free to modify the script or further customize the analysis as needed. For any questions or issues, please refer to the documentation of Pandas and Matplotlib or consult the developer community.

Happy analyzing!
